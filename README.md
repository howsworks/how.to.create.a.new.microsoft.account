Are you looking to create a Microsoft account with Gmail but don’t know where to start? We’ve got you covered. You can be up and running with a new account in just a few quick steps.
This article will walk you through the process.

## Creating a Microsoft Account With a Gmail Address

* You need a Microsoft account to sign in to Microsoft services such as Outlook.com, OneDrive, Windows Phone, and Xbox Live. You’ll also need one if you want to sign in to third-party applications that use a Microsoft account for authentication.

* A Microsoft account also gives you access to additional features such as managing your settings and preferences across devices, recovering your account if you forget your password, and two-step verification for added security.

* In addition, a Microsoft account allows you to sync your settings and files across devices, making it easier to switch between devices or pick up where you left off. If you have a Skype account, you can link it to your Microsoft account to make it even easier to stay connected with family and friends.

* But can you use Gmail to create a Microsoft account? The answer is yes.

* Even though Microsoft prefers an Outlook or Hotmail email account when users sign up for various services, the company also accepts accounts from other email service providers, including Gmail.

## Creating a Microsoft Account With Gmail on a New Computer

When reinstalling Windows or setting up your computer for the first time, you will be prompted to create a Microsoft Account. If you already have a Gmail account, you can use that to create your Microsoft Account.

1. At the **“Sign in with Microsoft”** screen, enter your Gmail address and then click on **“Create Account.”**

2. A new interface will open at this point, requesting you to set up the password you’d like to use to access your computer and the official Microsoft website. Type in the password and hit Enter.


3. Follow the rest of the onscreen instructions to complete setting up your computer.


**And that’s it! After successfully setting up your computer, you’ll be able to use your new account in all subsequent logins and make purchases on the Microsoft Store**

## Creating Microsoft Account With Gmail on an Existing Computer


Many Windows users are unaware they can sign in to a new device using a local account. With a local account, essentially a username and password, you’ll only be able to sign in to the device itself. This can be useful if you don’t want to connect your device to the internet or share personal information with Microsoft.

However, a local account means you cannot link Microsoft services such as Outlook.com, OneDrive, and Skype, nor can you restore your password remotely.

Fortunately, Windows allows you to open a Microsoft account if you used a local account during the initial setup.

**Here’s how**

1. Click on the Windows icon in the bottom left corner to open the Start Menu.

2. Scroll down the Start Menu and click on **“Settings.”**


3. Select **“Accounts”** from the Settings menu.

4. Select **“Your Info”** from the navigation menu on the left side of the screen.

5. Click on the “Sign in with a Microsoft account instead” link. This should open the sign-in page.


6. Click on the **“Create one”** link next to **“No account?”**


7. Enter your Gmail address on the next screen and create a password.


8. Choose your country from the dropdown list and click on **“Next.”**


9. On the next screen, Windows will display a **“what’s most relevant section”** where you should check the options you want (or uncheck those you don’t like). After that, click on **“Next.”**


10. Your new Microsoft account will be created and a verification code sent to your Gmail account. Copy and paste the code and click on **“Next.”**


11. Complete the process by setting up a security pin. You can also opt to bypass this step.
